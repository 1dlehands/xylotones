Xylotones.com

This is a site to create halftone images from user picture uploads. It interfaces with Amazon S3, via carrierwave and fog
to store images. 

The outcome of the algorithm is the information for dots. Each dot is then created as an SVG element that can be 
manipulated in the user's browser.

Current optimization work is going on in the branch "refactor_update."

Done
- write algorithm to analyze image and create dot information
- create basic user interface to select remove dots
- add ajax update to store which dots are deleted
- add mass selection tool to remove more dots at once
- push to heroku (xylotones.com)

ToDo
- optimize conversion algorithm
- add user tools
- add zoom to user viewport
- tie in ability to purchase design on consumer products
